# Python-challenge_APL
Python homework due on 4/8/2021 by Andrew Long


PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)


In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.



PyPoll

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
-------------------------
Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
